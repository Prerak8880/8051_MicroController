# Watch Dog Timer in 8051(AT89C51)

 ### 1. **What is a watchdog timer (WDT: Watchdog timer)** <br>
A watchdog timer (WDT) is a timer that monitors microcontroller (MCU) programs to see if they are out of control or have stopped operating. It acts as a “watchdog” watching over MCU operations.</br>

### 2. **WDT operation : Detection of MCU faults**<br>
The watchdog timer communicates with the MCU at a set interval. If the MCU does not output a signal, outputs too many signals or outputs signals that differ from a predetermined pattern, the timer determines that the MCU is malfunctioning and sends a reset signal to the MCU. </br>
