# RAIN DETECTION
<br>

A solution when it starts raining, for example
<be>
<br>
(1)  When the clothes are left to dry on the roof<br>
(2)  We can use it as a motor indicator when to switch off.<br>

Maybe there are a lot more uses that are possible, I have written the issues, that I have faced.<br>

## Materials Used:-
<br>
(1)  Rain sensor
(2)  8051 uC
(3)  LED
(4)  Jumper Wires
<br>
